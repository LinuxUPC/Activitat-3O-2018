# Activitat-3O-2018

This repo contains the activity done in 3O of linuxUPC.

## How it works
You just have to repair the code, guided by the comments. To compile just press F2
To reset the code press F8
As you repair the code and press F2 you will be given a puntuation. If you dont see any puntuation it means it does not compile.
For exiting the puntuation screen you just have to press enter, sometimes control + c.
